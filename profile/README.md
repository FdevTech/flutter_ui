## ðŸš€ About Me
just after my graduation from USTHB as a robotics engineer,
I started my journey as a mobile developer, I started my
journey as an Android developer using Java but after one
year I switched to Kotlin, couple of years later I discovered
Flutter which is a powerful tool to build cross-platform apps,
in my projects I follow the clean architecture approach
combining it with a different pattern such MVVM, MVP& MVI,
or even Bloc pattern (for flutter projects) for Dependency
injection I use Dager/Hilt for android and Getit for Flutter
projects.
